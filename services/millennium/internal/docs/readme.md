Millennium is the server for the client facing API for the AiBlocks ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between [aiblocks-core](https://www.aiblocks.io/developers/software/#aiblocks-core) and applications that want to access the AiBlocks network. It allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, subscribe to event streams, etc. See [an overview of the AiBlocks ecosystem](https://www.aiblocks.io/developers/guides/) for more details.

You can interact directly with millennium via curl or a web browser but SDF provides a [JavaScript SDK](https://www.aiblocks.io/developers/js-aiblocks-sdk/reference/) for clients to use to interact with Millennium.

SDF runs a instance of Millennium that is connected to the test net [https://millennium-testnet.aiblocks.io/](https://millennium-testnet.aiblocks.io/).
